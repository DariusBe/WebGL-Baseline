# *0*vert - Documentation

## About

*0*vert is a lightweight open-source 3D editor based on WebGL2.
It's the result of initial tests for a library to abstract the state machine of the graphics framework, but grew into a toolset to load models, create scenes, transform objects and render based on materials. While these features are (for the most part) implemented, they still wait to be fully integrated into editor's GUI. Stay tuned for more!

### Disclaimer

*0*vert is work-in-progress and not all options presented in the graphical user interface (GUI) are functioning yet. Use at your own discretion!

## Feature Roadmap

### WIP:

- Viewport Render display toggles (switch between solid, wireframe and lit scene rendering)
- Object Picking (support for selection of objects)

### Coming Soon:

- TFO (Transform Feedback Objects) to render arbitrary data, e.g. for particle systems
- direct GLSL input to Viewport target
- Undo/Redo functions
- ***

## Controls

- **Select Object**: `RMB`
- **Select multiple Objects**: `shift+RMB`
- **Orbit Camera**: `alt+LMB` on Windows or `option+LMB` on Mac
